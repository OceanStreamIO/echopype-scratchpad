# Running NASC Notebooks: Instructions

- All notebooks depend on the `echopype` project
- The notebooks provided in the `NASC` folder should be copied into `/echopype/notebooks` before running them. When running the notebooks, the `mask_impulse_noise.py` file must be present in the mask module from `echopype/echopype/mask`. Additionally, `mask_transformation.py` must be present in the utils module from `echopype/echopype/utils`.
