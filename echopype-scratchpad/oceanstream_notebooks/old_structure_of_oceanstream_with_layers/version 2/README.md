**Running `L0_tour.ipynb`, `L2_tour.ipynb`, `L3_tour.ipynb` notebooks: instructions**

- The notebooks `L0_tour.ipynb`, `L2_tour.ipynb`, and `L3_tour.ipynb` serve as guides outlining the necessary steps to prepare the draft of the main function for an IoT Edge device. They cover data reading, denoising, and processing.
    - All these notebooks are dependent on the `oceanstream` project.
    - Before running, ensure the notebooks from the `oceanstream_notebooks` folder are copied to `/oceanstream/notebooks`.
    - To execute them, test data is required.
