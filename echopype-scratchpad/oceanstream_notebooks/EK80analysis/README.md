**Instructions for Running the Notebooks**

- The notebooks are used for analyzing memory-related problems that occur in oceanstream while reading EK80 data.
    - Please note that these notebooks rely on the `oceanstream` project.
    - Before proceeding, make sure to copy the notebooks from the `echopype-scratchpad/echopype-scratchpad/oceanstream_notebooks/EK80analysis` folder to the `/oceanstream/notebooks` directory.
